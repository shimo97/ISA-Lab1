TEST BENCH
-clk_gen 
untouched

-data_maker_new
changed H0,H1,... into b0, b1,...
added generics for Nb and filter latency
slightly changed SIM_ENDi shift register

-data_sink
added generics for Nb and filter latency
added automatic error checking from input file (ERR[3:0] vector)
ERR[3:0]=[ MISSING DATA | LATENCY ERROR | DATA ERROR | GLOBAL ERROR ]

-tb_fir
modified blocks interfaces (changed H0,H1,.. to b0,b1,... and added data_sink DUT_VIN and ERR vector)
added DUT_VIN and ERR wires

-fake_dut
created this block to test the functionality of test bench, it simply contains shift registers for VIN and DIN
